An app that can be used to send/receive text messages. All the messages are stored in server, hence reducing the app size. The messages are retrieved from the server using API calls etc and are displayed, after signing in.

## Insights of the App

The app is a basic version of various chat application present these days, but the app includes features like HTTP requests, API calls etc while having an established communication between the App and the Server. 
The Json data is decoded and the necessary items are displayed using various Packages, Widgets etc like ListViews, SpeedDial etc
The app can be directly run on both Android and iOS(Thanks to Flutter :))

PS: Do not try to run the code directly, The secret-Key(Password) is not available and hence will pop up errors.
